# Getting started with UoH's CMS group

Congratulation on joining the CMS group at the University of Hyderabad. 

Before starting your journey into the world of experimental particle physics and the CMS experiment, 
you need to get a few things set up.
To perform any computing operation with CMS and CERN, you need a CERN Computing Account and register yourself with CMS. Follow [this link](./cern_cms_registration.mdx) to know how to do so.

The computing account with get you access to various machines and services at CERN. You can access linux servers at CERN through a service called [lxplus](https://lxplusdoc.web.cern.ch/). 
If you are not familiar working with linux, its a good idea look at the [linux doc](./linux.mdx) or refer to online resources.

If you don't have a computer or laptop, you could the [desktops at CMSLab](./computing.mdx#desktops-at-cmslab) or contact your supervisor. 
For heavier loads and data storage, we have a [powerful linux server](../hardware/cmslab-workstation.mdx) installed in the lab.

If you do have a laptop or computer, you would want to use Linux for your daily work. Contact your labmates to assistance to install linux on your laptop.

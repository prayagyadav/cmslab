## Connect to university network through a vpn

Connect to https://14.139.69.5:8443 and download the SSL VPN configuration file for your device. To know how, check [this pdf](/doc/how_to_connect_over_vpn.pdf). \
Contact Dr. Bhawna Gomber for login credentials.

You also have to download a vpn client on your device which accepts openvpn config files. Links to the vpn client downloads are given in https://14.139.169.5:8443 for Windows and MacOS . For linux, you have to download the openvpn service. If you have an debian distribution like Ubuntu, Linux mint etc. follow these steps to download openvpn:
1. Go on to the terminal and run :
```bash
sudo apt-get install openvpn
```
2. To start the vpn connection run:
```bash
sudo openvpn  /path/to/bhawnagsp__ssl_vpn_config.ovpn
```
Doing this will connect to the UoH internal network. So any site or server that stays inside the UoH network could be accessed now.
 You can check that by connecting to https://10.4.48.61 on your browser(accept the security warning and proceed to 10.4.48.61)
  You could ssh to your account as usual with `ssh <username>@10.4.48.61`

When you are already in the University network connected via wifi or LAN , it is wiser to connect directly `ssh <username>@10.4.48.61` without vpn

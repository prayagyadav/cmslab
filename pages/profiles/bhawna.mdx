## Research
My research interests lies in understanding the mystery of dark matter. My thesis work involved search for anomalous production of mono-photon events along with momentum imbalance in transverse plane. If an excess is found, could be interpreted as dark matter recoiling from the high PT photons. After my Ph.D degree, I spent  rst year of my post-doctoral term working on \The LUX-Zeplin (LZ)" liquid-xenon WIMP dark matter direct search experiment, understanding the background techniques and simulations. Since the beginning of LHC run II in November 2015, I am stationed at CERN and continuing with dark matter search with run II data of the CMS experiment. Since both the direct-detection and collider searches compliment each other, I have the experience to understand the technicalities on both fronts. 

- Understanding of detector and software of both "CMS" and "LZ" experiments. 
- My research activities at CMS includes analyzing data for the search of: Dark Matter particles, Extra Dimensions, Trilinear Gauge Couplings and Invisible Higgs decays. 
- My research activities at LZ includes understanding the radiogenic backgrounds, validation of the LZ simulation using Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST) model. 
- I have been working as the trigger expert for exotica search analysis team of the CMS experiment. 
- During my research appointments I have guided and worked with many Ph.D and masters students from different universities. 
- I have also organized tutorials for CMS Data Analysis School at Fermilab. 
- I have presented several talks and posters in many international conferences based on my work and on behalf of both the CMS and LZ collaboration.
